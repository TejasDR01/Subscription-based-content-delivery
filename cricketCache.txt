Experience tells you that whoever takes over next â€“ and it looks as if it will be Ben Stokes â€“ will end up in a similar place. Sooner or later, the captaincy becomes a study in watching a good man get ground down. The question is what he and his team can achieve along the way. The Spin | Too weak, too stern, too strict, too lax: a brief history of England coaches Read more It makes you wonder what it is about leading England in particular that seems to take so much out of a cricketer (and why, as Derek Underwood once asked, â€œso many players want to be captain anywayâ€?). Doug Insole , who led Essex in the 1950s and did a stretch as Peter Mayâ€™s deputy when England toured South Africa in 1956-57, said a captain needs to be â€œa public relations officer, agricultural consultant, psychiatrist, accountant, nursemaid, and diplomatâ€?, as well as a player, selector and tactician. It tells you plenty about how stiff the job is that Joe Root ended up in the position he did even though he seemed to do so well in so many of those different roles. He had the batting. Unlike Mike Brearley, Root always demanded a place in the team, since he was the best batsman in the country; unlike Michael Vaughan, he was able to maintain the best part of his form while he was leading it, even if his batting average did drop a few points. And he had the manâ€‘management. Unlike Andrew Strauss, Root always seemed to have the support of all of his players, who never had a bad word to say about him (in Afrikaans or any other language). But Brearley, Vaughan and Strauss will be remembered as three of the best captains England had. Unlike Root. Root never ended up on the front pages of the papers after being accused of having a tryst with a barmaid in his hotel room during a Test, never squared off with an umpire in the middle of a match because he didnâ€™t agree with his decision, never got caught rubbing dirt on the ball, never called a foreign journalist a buffoon in a press conference, never turned up for practice so hungover that his coach made him sit out the session because he thought he was still drunk (if that last one seems like a low bar, it is still one that one of his predecessors failed to get over). Root didnâ€™t look at his team and say: â€œMy God, look what theyâ€™ve sent me,â€? which is what Archie MacLaren came out with when the selectors announced his side to play Australia at Old Trafford. And he never greeted one of his debutants with: â€œGracious me! Donâ€™t tell me youâ€™re playing!â€? as Johnny Douglas is supposed to have done. He was never run out by one of his own teammates because they were so fed up with him, like Geoff Boycott, never provoked one of the most pitiless attacks ever put together by promising to make them â€œgrovelâ€?, like Tony Greig . Andrew Strauss led England to some memorable successes but struggled with his batting and some relationships in the dressing room. Photograph: Gareth Copley/PA What Root didnâ€™t have was that touch of the mystic that may just be the most venerated quality of all. â€œCaptaincy,â€? said Richie Benaud , â€œis the ability to think ahead of play, not be left responding to it.â€? Root didnâ€™t have a feel for bowling changes or field placings. Although, since everyone in the game has got an opinion on how to do the job, you donâ€™t have to look far to find good judges who will tell you that side of it is overrated anyway. â€œâ€˜A dynamic bowling changeâ€™ you write about is probably sheer luck nine times out of 10,â€? said Graham Gooch when he was captain. â€œOK, you bring on someone and he gets a wicket â€“ great, but I havenâ€™t solved the mysteries of the universe have I?â€? The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email. There are myriad ways to fail, so many that even when youâ€™re winning, there will be plenty who think youâ€™re going about it in the wrong way (as Strauss found out). It feels as if the England captain isnâ€™t just leading the 10 other players on the field, but the entirety of English cricket. Perhaps the last man who really managed it was May, who Wisden described as â€œthe beau ideal of English sportsmanshipâ€?. However, even he fell out with the press when he brought his fiancee on tour. May finished with the captaincy when he was 31. After he quit, Wisden waited nine years before publishing a tribute to him because everyone was hoping he would make a comeback. Thereâ€™s a lesson there for Stokes when the time comes: itâ€™s best to quit while youâ€™re ahead if you can. Theyâ€™ll remember you better for it.","image_url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4215e5e617d75e9a1af9279c786d2f70ff38acae/62_101_1998_1199/master/1998.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a416a8aeff9470835ec0043d56e5478a","source_id":"theguardian","country":["united kingdom","india","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL 2022 GT vs SRH Highlights: Gujarat Titans beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by 5 wickets - The Indian Express","link":"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9zcG9ydHMvaXBsL2lwbC0yMDIyLWd0LXZzLXNyaC1odWdobGlnaHRzLTc4OTAwMzYv0gEA?oc=5","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"IPL 2022 GT vs SRH Highlights: Gujarat Titans beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by 5 wicketsÂ Â The Indian ExpressHighlights | IPL 2022, GT vs SRH Scorecard: Rashid-Tewatia Survive Umran Scare To Lead GT To VictoryÂ Â India.comLive Cricket Score - GT vs SRH, Match 40, IPL 2022 | Cricbuzz.com - CricbuzzÂ Â CricbuzzIPL 2022, GT vs SRH Highlights: Gujarat Titans Edge Past SunRisers Hyderabad, Win By 5 WicketsÂ Â NDTV SportsRecent Match Report - Sunrisers vs Titans 40th Match 2022Â Â ESPNcricinfoView Full coverage on Google News","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-04-27 18:22:41","image_url":null,"source_id":"google","country":["india"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"IPL 2022 Points Table, Orange Cap and Purple Cap Latest Table Today: SRH reclaim top spot after beating SRH","link":"https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/ipl-2022-points-table-orange-cap-and-purple-cap-latest-table-today-srh-reclaim-top-spot-after-beating-srh-10447751.html","keywords":["First Cricket News"],"creator":["FirstCricket Staff"],"video_url":null,"description":"IPL 2022 Points Table, Orange Cap and Purple Cap Latest Table Today: SRH reclaim top spot after beating SRH","content":"IPL 2022 has in store new teams, changed squad line-ups and a different format.

During the 40th match of the ongoing 15th season of the Indian Premier League between Gujarat Titans and Sunrisers Hyderabad at the Wankhede Stadium, Gujarat Titans beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by 5 wickets to reclaim their position at the top of the points table. Chasing a 196-run target, GT needed 47 runs in the last three overs to register their seventh victory of the season. With their specialist batters getting out, Gujarat thrived on the back of a match-winning 59-run sixth-wicket partnership between all-rounder Rahul Tewatia (40*) and vice-captain Rashid Khan (31*). Needing as many as 22 runs in the last over being bowled by Marco Jansen, Tewatia and Khan hit one and three sixes to seal an emphatic chase tonight. While Tewatia batted with a strike rate of 190.47, Khan smashed four sixes at a strike rate of 281.81. Having conceded 45 runs in the first innings without picking a wicket, Khan made amends by a game-changing contribution with the bat in hand. Before these two dominated the proceedings, Hyderabad got off to a brilliant start on the back of wicket-keeper batter Wriddhiman Saha contributing with 68 (38) with the help of 11 fours and a six. Tewatia and Khanâ€™s heroic 24-ball partnership meant that SRH pacer Umran Malikâ€™s (4-0-25-5) maiden T20 five-wicket would result in a losing cause.
