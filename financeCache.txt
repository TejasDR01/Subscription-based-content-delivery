During the budget speech of 2021-22, the Tamil Nadu Finance Minister had said that Rs 2 crore will be allotted initially for the establishment of a separate Siddha medical university for Indian systems of medicine. What is to be noted is that the Bill proposes Tami Nadu's Chief Minister be the Chancellor of the university. This comes just two days after the TN Assembly adopted two Bills that vest powers with the government to appoint Vice-Chancellors, instead of the Governor, who has historically been the Chancellor of all state universities in the country. The Tamil Nadu Governor has been facing backlash in the state ever since he refused to pass on a Bill exempting Tamil Nadu from NEET for the President's Assent, twice. The new university's Vice-Chancellor will be appointed by the Chief Minister, who will be the Chancellor, from among three names recommended by a selection committee. The Minister of Health and Family Welfare of the state will be the Pro-Chancellor. Highlighting the \"rich traditions and literature\" of the AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy) medical systems, the Bill declares that the new university will research the scientific validation of medicines in these systems, in order to develop them further for a wider, more global reach.Â  According to the Bill, the main objective of the university will be to provide programmes for research and advancement and dissemination of knowledge in Indian medicine and homeopathy. \"In order to develop Siddha and other systems of Indian medicines and homeopathy, giving due importance to research, the government considers that a separate university may be established for the purpose,\" the Bill said. It also mentions the fabled ability of sages in Tamil Nadu and all over India, who harnessed traditional knowledge of the human body to cure illnesses. \"Accordingly, the Siddha tradition was developed by the Siddhars in Tamil Nadu. Similarly, Ayurveda and Yoga evolved throughout India, while the Homeopathy and Unani traditions, though initially evolved outside India, have assimilated themselves into Indian culture,\" the Bill detailed.","pubDate":"2022-04-28 02:57:00","image_url":"https://images.edexlive.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2021/12/20/w600X390/MK_Stalin_EPS12.jpeg","source_id":"edexlive","country":["india"],"category":["top"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Share Market Live: Sensex, Nifty Set To Open Lower; HUL, Bajaj Auto, HDFC AMC, RIL, ONGC In Focus","link":"https://www.bloombergquint.com/markets/share-market-live-sensex-nifty-set-to-open-lower-hul-bajaj-auto-hdfc-amc-ril-ongc-in-focus","keywords":["Bajaj Auto Ltd.","Oil & Natural Gas Corporation Ltd.","SENSEX","Hindustan Unilever Ltd.","Reliance Industries Ltd.","HDFC Asset Management Company Ltd.","NIFTY 50","MARKETS","bqfree"],"creator":["Bharath Rajeswaran"],"video_url":null,"description":"Catch all live updates on share prices, index moves, corporate announcements and more from the Sensex and Nifty, today.","content":"Trade Setup For ThursdayRupee, Bonds Could Fall As Treasury Yields JumpIndian government bonds and the rupee could be weighed down by the rise in U.S. Treasury yields overnight.Rupee 0.1% to 76.5262 against the U.S. dollar on Wednesday10-year yieldsÂ rose 3bps to 7.08% on Wednesday.Global fundsÂ sold net Rs 4,060 crore of India stocks Wednesday: NSEThey sold Rs 113 crore ofÂ sovereignÂ bonds under limits available to foreign investors, and withdrew Rs 130 crore ofÂ corporateÂ debtState-run banksÂ boughtÂ Rs 826 crore of sovereign bonds on April 27: CCIL data.

Sitharaman had announced the launch of the CBDC in her Budget speech two months ago and the RBI is readying pilots for both the wholesale and retail components, which are expected to be rolled out over the next few months. The FM, however, said that the government will take a nuanced approach on private cryptocurrencies due to concerns over its misuse. \"It will have to take its time...all of us to be sure that at least with a given available information, we're taking the decent decision. It can't be rushed through,\" she said at Stanford University , while reiterating her concerns over the possible use of these instruments for money laundering or terror financing. Sitharaman also cautioned that in an interconnected world, sanctions could have unintended consequences, and India is trying to work through them. She said India's stand on the Russia-Ukraine war is with the view to safeguard its economic and security interest. \"So, India's position is not just for its economic interests, but also its security interests.
