Nepalese Regulatorâ€™s Crypto Warning Nepalâ€™s regulator of the technology sector, the Nepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA), issued a notice Monday warning the public about engaging in illegal activities, specifically naming cryptocurrency, bitcoin, and online gambling. Noting that transactions using digital technologies, such as cryptocurrency, have been on the rise in Nepal, the NTA stressed that websites, apps, and online networks related to crypto activities are prohibited to be used, operated, or managed within the country. The regulator proceeded to warn the public that activities involving cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, are â€œillegal and criminal,â€? elaborating: If anyone is found to be doing or have done such activities, action will be taken according to the prevailing law. In March, at the request of the countryâ€™s Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, the NTA directed internet service providers (ISPs) to shut down all crypto trading websites and apps. They are now disabled and blacklisted, the regulator stressed. The ministry reportedly told the NTA that the trading of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, has increased economic crime in the country. Surya Prasad Lamichhane, NTAâ€™s deputy director, was quoted as saying: The government has directed [us] to shut down the apps after carrying out an investigation. The Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) of Nepal Police has also arrested and taken action against some people carrying out crypto business. The Nepal Rastra Bank, the countryâ€™s central bank, issued a directive earlier this year banning all Nepali nationals and non-nationals living in the country from buying and investing in cryptocurrencies. The central bank cited increased fraud risk and illegal outflow of domestic capital as the key reasons.

President Faustin Archange Touadera validated the law Wednesday, saying that the exchange rate between cryptocurrencies and the FCFA is freely determined by the market. Tax contributions can also be paid in cryptocurrencies through platforms recognized by the government, the government statement said. It said the country is now the \"first country in Africa to adopt bitcoin as a reference currency.\" Central African Republic is among the world's poorest countries , according to the United Nations, and has been in a state insecurity and increasing violence for nine years. The government controls the capital, but much of the country is controlled by armed groups. Many officials and civil society groups including Citizens Standing in Solidarity with Central African Republic have protested this law, saying it risks national sovereignty. \"By imposing cryptocurrencies as national currency, the power of Bangui has just sold off the little that still remained of the authority of the State and its power to control its economy, and therefore its development,\" the group said in a statement.

CHO NFT Sale is the first of its kind token sale for the crypto market. Thanks to the revolutionary web 3.0 technologies, the Choise.com team combined the selling power of the NFT collection (DeFi) and the traditional token sale (CeFi) to create the worldâ€™s first MetaFi NFT collection. Yesterday, the first DeFi users were able to become owners of CHO tokens through purchasing NFTs. Choise.com Team has recorded increased interest in the CHO NFT Sale from the Community: 1,000 NFTs were redeemed for a total amount of $160,000. A total of 1,000 NFTs were issued and now act as a â€œkeyâ€? to CHO tokens, which can be claimed directly from the userâ€™s profile on the Choise.com website. CHO token sale followed standard GameFi attributes: buyers randomly received rare NFTs that provided bonuses, including additional free CHO tokens and attractive unlocks from 50 to 100%. â€œLetâ€™s not hide the fact that Choise.com was created as a â€œrevolutionaryâ€? project for the cryptocurrency market. The launch of such NFTs was the proof of that. Already now we can say with confidence that Choise.com will continue to develop in the direction of innovation. The roadmap within the overall strategy involves the introduction of completely new products for the cryptocurrency market, which have no analogues at the moment and which will be introduced and announced throughout the coming months,â€? said Choise.com COO Austin Kimm. About Choise.com Choise.com is a MetaFi (CeFi/DeFi) ecosystem based on Crypterium CeFi solutions and the Charism DeFi protocol that finds new solutions to run CeFi protocols. The MetaFi ecosystem includes both the CeFi engines already used by the Crypterium platform and the highly profitable DeFi tools that are in development. In April 2022, Choise.com successfully completed three funding stages conducted on the Crypterium platform, SolRazr, OccamRazer, and Bitbns launchpads, selling 100% of the announced CHO tokens for a total of $1.47 million.

The report shows that the median Chivo wallet user made no deposits or withdrawals in a given month. NBER Study: Only 4 out of 10 Salvadorans Use Chivo Wallet After Governmentâ€™s Bitcoin Bonus An April 2022 working study published by the NBER, asks if cryptocurrencies are indeed currencies after researching bitcoin (BTC) as legal tender in El Salvador. NBER conducted a face-to-face survey with 1,800 Salvadoran households during the month of February 2022. The study shows that Salvadorans are not using the Chivo wallet that much and in February, El Salvadorâ€™s central bank noted that only 1.6% of remittances were sent via digital wallets. â€œMost users who used Chivo after spending the $30 bonus do not engage with the app intensively,â€? the report highlights. In fact, the NBER researchers found that the fixed cost to adopt the Chivo wallet was very large. Moreover, if it wasnâ€™t for the $30 bitcoin bonus, the study estimates that 75% of the Salvadorans surveyed would have never used it. NBER researchers note that only four out of ten people who downloaded Chivo wallet are actually using the application. 88% of Bitcoin Accepting Businesses Convert Back to Dollars, Study Concludes by Noting Bitcoin Is Not a Widely Accepted Currency in El Salvador â€œThe elasticity of substitution between Chivo Wallet and other methods of payment seems to be large,â€? the study adds. â€œOn net, among Chivo Wallet users, 10% report spending less in cash, and 11% report reducing their use of debit or credit cards since they downloaded Chivo.â€? Unfortunately, despite all the reporting that says otherwise, NBERâ€™s study claims only 20% of Salvadoran businesses reported on accepting bitcoin as a medium of exchange. 90% of those businesses were enterprises and â€œ88% of businesses transform money from sales in bitcoin into dollars.â€? NBERâ€™s findings further note that roughly 5% of Salvadorans paid their tax obligations via bitcoin (BTC). â€œOverall, despite the legal tender status of bitcoin and the large incentives implemented by the government, the cryptocurrency is largely not an accepted medium of exchange in El Salvador,â€? the NBER research paper concludes. What do you think about the NBERâ€™s study and findings among the 1,800 Salvadoran households?

Wednesdayâ€™s selloff has seen prices fall by as much as 4%, whilst ETH also declined by the same amount. Bitcoin The worldâ€™s largest cryptocurrency moved lower on Wednesday, following a brief rally during yesterdayâ€™s trading session. Following a peak of $40,330.46 on Tuesday, BTC/USD slipped to an intraday bottom of $37,884.99 on hump-day. This latest low sees BTC continue to trade near its $37,700 support level, and close to a recent one-month low. Since todayâ€™s floor, prices have gone on to climb and bitcoin is currently hovering near the $38,910.00 level. Looking at the chart, the 14-day RSI is also tracking above its own ceiling of 39.50, with the potential for it to move to a higher resistance of 43. Should this happen, not only will we see the current floor continue to hold firm, but we may also be positioned for a run towards $41,000. Ethereum ETH was also unable to sustain gains made during Tuesdayâ€™s session, as prices once again dropped below $3,000. The worldâ€™s second-largest cryptocurrency hit a bottom of $2,786.25 earlier today, which comes less than 24 hours after it traded close to $3,046. Todayâ€™s drop saw prices find support at the $2,780 level, which has historically been a soft landing spot for retreating bulls. This proved to be the case yet again, as ETH/USD bounded from its earlier low, and is now trading at $2,862.25. Looking at the chart, this is still roughly 3.98% lower than yesterdayâ€™s peak, and comes as RSI attempts to move away from a six-week low. Glancing ahead, the $2,950 resistance seems to be the only real obstacle in the way of any further runs deep into the $3,000 region. Do you expect crypto consolidation to continue into May?
