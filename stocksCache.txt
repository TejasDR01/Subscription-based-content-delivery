Punjab has already bought power worth over Rs 200 crore to meet the rising demand, which is up by over 30 to 40% as compared to last year. Now with the increasing temperature, the shortage will lead to more power cuts.Punjab's transmission capacity increasedThe Centre has enhanced Punjab's power transmission capacity from outside the state to a record 9,000 MW with a reliability margin of 500 MWNow, the state can meet the power demand of more than 15,000 MW during the paddy season, which starts June onwards\"At present, the demand is somewhere around 8,150 MW and following a shortage of around 800 MW due to the two units facing technical issues, the supply is less,\" says a senior PSPCL official.A senior PSPCL official said on Monday, Punjab saw 1,740 lakh units of power consumption as compared to 1,106 lakh units during the last season. While the PSPCL managed the supply on Monday, it fell short due to the shutting down of two units on Tuesday.\"Due to the shortage, we have no other option but to levy cuts as agricultural fields and the industries need power due to their peak season. As a result, villages are facing cuts and if the situation doesn't improve, we'll have no option but to go for longer outages in the cities as well,\" said the official, preferring anonymity.Meanwhile, the shortage of coal means the power generation at almost all thermal plants is less than their full capacity, ahead of the paddy season starting June when Punjab's power demand will reach 15,000 MW.While the PSPCL claims that the \"power interruptions are for a limited period\" due to \"high demand during night\", experts warn of longer cuts in coming four months.\"Due to limited coal stocks and long dry spells, the power demand is high. If rains elude Punjab in June, power cuts can haunt the state consumers for longer duration,\" said VK Gupta, spokesperson, All India Power Engineers Federation, spokesperson.Notably, the daily coal requirement of all five thermal plants is around 75 MT while operating at the plant load factor of more than 85%. Despite running at a reduced capacity, the thermal plants in Punjab are not getting even half the daily coal requirement.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-04-27 23:34:05","image_url":"https://englishtribuneimages.blob.core.windows.net/gallary-content/2022/4/2022_4$largeimg_1654008044.jpg","source_id":"tribuneindia","country":["india"],"category":["top"],"language":"english"},{"title":"U.S. Futures, Stocks Rise; Yen Dips Ahead of BOJ: Markets Wrap","link":"https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/u-s-tech-bounce-boosts-sentiment-before-asia-open-markets-wrap","keywords":["ALLTOP","BUSINESS","EUROPE","EURTOP","MARKETS","NORTHAM","TOP","US","WWTOP","WORLD","GLOBALMACR","STK","WRP","RUSSIA","Bloomberg","WWTOPAM","WWTOPAS","WWTOPEU","bqmetered"],"creator":["Andreea Papuc"],"video_url":null,"description":"Track the global equity, currency & commodity markets here.","content":"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. equity futures and an Asian stock gauge rose Thursday amid steadier investor sentiment following a surge in Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. and more pledges of economic support from China.Continue Reading.

The NSE Nifty 50 index fell 1.89% to 17,142.50, as of 0445 GMT, while the S&P BSE Sensex slid 2.15% to 57,089.44. In a holiday truncated week, both indexes logged weekly losses of more than 1.5% each, last week. On Monday, software services provider Infosys slumped 9.1% to an eight-month low. The firm's consolidated net profit for the March quarter was 56.86 billion rupees ($744.24 million), lower than analysts' expectation of 59.80 billion rupees. That dragged the Nifty's IT sub-index down more than 4%, making it the biggest decliner among major sub-indexes. Last week, rival Tata Consultancy Services also slightly missed estimates. Its shares slid 3.5% to a one-month low on Monday. \"It was a weak set of numbers from Infosys and TCS also was a disappointment; the companies are under a lot of cost pressure and this will affect mid-cap stocks and we will see a valuation reset,\" said Saurabh Jain, assistant vice president at SMC Securities. Mindtree was down 5% ahead of March quarter results. Beyond IT stocks, India's top private-sector lender HDFC Bank extended losses to an eighth session, slipping 3.5% after it posted March quarter results over the weekend. The bank's net interest margin, a key measure of profitability, contracted due to rise in share of corporate loans and slower growth in credit cards and auto loans, brokerage Jefferies said in a note. Meanwhile, several markets in Asia and Europe were closed on Monday. U.S. equity futures, however, declined amid a rise in oil prices due to the deepening crisis in Ukraine. [O/R] \"Globally, inflation concerns continue to be on investors' minds; any new developments on the Russia-Ukraine situation would be a key deciding factor going forward,\" Jain added. 0 Comments (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)
