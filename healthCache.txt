Justice P Krishna Bhat said the petitioner cannot have any vested right as to how his performance is going to be assessed by the university.Â  The petitioner, TN Manu Kumar, is a student of the Government College of Pharmacy in Bengaluru. He had petitioned the High Court to declare the notification issued on February 23, 2021, by the RGUHS as not applicable for the academic year 2020-21. The notification said that grace marks awarded to a student will be up to five marks per semester, with a minimum of three marks in any one subject. This is based on the condition that the student passes all subjects of that semester and it is applicable for students admitted from the academic year 2020-21 onwards. The High Court refused to interfere in matters of evaluation that are the responsibility of the university. \"As already noticed, the petitioner was fully aware at least about 3 months in advance the standard by which his performance is going to be evaluated and what would be the minimum marks he was required to secure before he would claim to have passed the examination,\" the court added.","pubDate":"2022-04-28 02:59:00","image_url":"https://images.edexlive.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2021/12/13/w600X390/Karnataka_High_Court_EPS_2.jpg","source_id":"edexlive","country":["india"],"category":["top"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Tamil Nadu proposes new university for traditional medicine with CM as Chancellor","link":"https://www.edexlive.com/news/2022/apr/28/tamil-nadu-proposes-new-university-for-traditional-medicine-with-cm-as-chancellor-28553.html","keywords":null,"creator":["Edexlive"],"video_url":null,"description":"The university, which will research AYUSH medicine, will be established in Chennai and will work on research and knowledge enhancement in traditional medicine","content":"The Tamil Nadu government has introduced a Bill in the Assembly to establish a medical university for Siddha, Ayurveda, Unani, Yoga and Naturopathy and Homeopathy in the state.Â  Health Minister Ma Subramanian, who tabled the Bill, said that the new university will be called The Tamil Nadu Siddha Medical University and will be located in the Chennai metropolitan area. During the budget speech of 2021-22, the Tamil Nadu Finance Minister had said that Rs 2 crore will be allotted initially for the establishment of a separate Siddha medical university for Indian systems of medicine. What is to be noted is that the Bill proposes Tami Nadu's Chief Minister be the Chancellor of the university. This comes just two days after the TN Assembly adopted two Bills that vest powers with the government to appoint Vice-Chancellors, instead of the Governor, who has historically been the Chancellor of all state universities in the country. The Tamil Nadu Governor has been facing backlash in the state ever since he refused to pass on a Bill exempting Tamil Nadu from NEET for the President's Assent, twice. The new university's Vice-Chancellor will be appointed by the Chief Minister, who will be the Chancellor, from among three names recommended by a selection committee. The Minister of Health and Family Welfare of the state will be the Pro-Chancellor. Highlighting the \"rich traditions and literature\" of the AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy) medical systems, the Bill declares that the new university will research the scientific validation of medicines in these systems, in order to develop them further for a wider, more global reach.Â  According to the Bill, the main objective of the university will be to provide programmes for research and advancement and dissemination of knowledge in Indian medicine and homeopathy. \"In order to develop Siddha and other systems of Indian medicines and homeopathy, giving due importance to research, the government considers that a separate university may be established for the purpose,\" the Bill said. It also mentions the fabled ability of sages in Tamil Nadu and all over India, who harnessed traditional knowledge of the human body to cure illnesses. \"Accordingly, the Siddha tradition was developed by the Siddhars in Tamil Nadu. Similarly, Ayurveda and Yoga evolved throughout India, while the Homeopathy and Unani traditions, though initially evolved outside India, have assimilated themselves into Indian culture,\" the Bill detailed.","pubDate":"2022-04-28 02:57:00","image_url":"https://images.edexlive.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2021/12/20/w600X390/MK_Stalin_EPS12.jpeg","source_id":"edexlive","country":["india"],"category":["top"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Share Market Live: Sensex, Nifty Set To Open Lower; HUL, Bajaj Auto, HDFC AMC, RIL, ONGC In Focus","link":"https://www.bloombergquint.com/markets/share-market-live-sensex-nifty-set-to-open-lower-hul-bajaj-auto-hdfc-amc-ril-ongc-in-focus","keywords":["Bajaj Auto Ltd.","Oil & Natural Gas Corporation Ltd.","SENSEX","Hindustan Unilever Ltd.","Reliance Industries Ltd.","HDFC Asset Management Company Ltd.","NIFTY 50","MARKETS","bqfree"],"creator":["Bharath Rajeswaran"],"video_url":null,"description":"Catch all live updates on share prices, index moves, corporate announcements and more from the Sensex and Nifty, today.","content":"Trade Setup For ThursdayRupee, Bonds Could Fall As Treasury Yields JumpIndian government bonds and the rupee could be weighed down by the rise in U.S. Treasury yields overnight.Rupee 0.1% to 76.5262 against the U.S. dollar on Wednesday10-year yieldsÂ rose 3bps to 7.08% on Wednesday.Global fundsÂ sold net Rs 4,060 crore of India stocks Wednesday: NSEThey sold Rs 113 crore ofÂ sovereignÂ bonds under limits available to foreign investors, and withdrew Rs 130 crore ofÂ corporateÂ debtState-run banksÂ boughtÂ Rs 826 crore of sovereign bonds on April 27: CCIL data.

The study, published April 27 in JAMA Psychiatry , found that stress surrounding the pandemic in the United States declined in children after the vaccinations were rolled out for adults in December 2020. Children who are living in states with higher vaccination rates may be less worried about the future of this pandemic. Getting vaccinated may also affect the mental health of parents and the home environment that kids are living in.\" Dr. Yunyu Xiao, lead author, assistant professor of population health sciences at Weill Cornell Medicine Social determinants of health that influenced children's mental health during the pandemic include food insecurity, unemployment, disrupted access to health care, and having parents who were essential workers. \"Many of these structural and social issues existed before the pandemic but were further exacerbated by it,\" Dr. Xiao said. Dr. Xiao and her colleagues, Dr. John J. Mann of Columbia University, Dr. Paul Yip of the University of Hong Kong and Dr. Jyotishman Pathak of Weill Cornell Medicine, assessed data from 8,493 children in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, a long-term analysis of brain development in children funded by the National Institutes of Health with 21 research sites across the United States. This study also included survey data about the mental and social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the researchers evaluated geocoded COVID-19 data describing the local environment-;including COVID-19 prevalence and social distancing metrics-;for each study participant. They also cross-referenced vaccination eligibility data, as well as full vaccination rates for adults across 17 states. They discovered that stress, sadness, and COVID-related worry decreased significantly after the adult vaccination rollout. Moreover, children living in states with later vaccination eligibility dates for adults or fewer fully vaccinated adults experienced greater COVID-related worry and stress. Groups of children that reported high rates of stress were older, female, Hispanic, had parents who were separated, experienced interruptions to healthcare, lived in economically deprived neighborhoods or in areas with more full-time, working-class adults who were unable to social distance; that is, essential workers. Children who were Asian, Black, or multi-racial also reported higher rates of COVID-related worry than white children. A variety of local, statewide, and federal policies can help to alleviate stress in children, including those that seek to vaccinate the adults in their lives, Dr. Xiao said. In addition, policies that target food insecurity and offer nutrition assistance, extend unemployment insurance and moratoria on housing evictions, expand healthcare coverage, and support essential workers would also be beneficial. The development and expansion of broadband services so that more communities have access to telehealth services is another avenue that should be explored. \"Structural level changes are needed to prepare for the next public health emergency,\" Dr. Xiao said. Dr. Xiao and the study team plan to investigate additional social determinants of health, including the pandemic preparedness of schools and the pre-pandemic mental health of children, and how they have influenced the overall well-being of children. \"We also want to better understand how various policies that have been implemented are affecting children's mental health,\" she said. \"This could ultimately help policymakers know what resources they should invest in.\" Weill Cornell Medicine Xiao, Y., et al.

They can also be a time when some students have to navigate their own physical and mental health for the first time without parental support. College is a key developmental time; the age of onset for lifetime mental health problems also directly coincides with traditional college years-;75 percent of lifetime mental health problems will onset by age 24.\" Sarah K. Lipson, assistant professor of health law, policy, and management, Boston University School of Public Health For more than 10 years, she's studied college student mental health with the Healthy Minds Network, a national project she coleads with researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, the University of Michigan, and Wayne State University. In a new study, Lipson and her colleagues reveal just how common depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues are, and how these issues take a toll on students of color unequally. The paper looks at survey data collected by the Healthy Minds Network between 2013 and 2021 from 350,000 students at over 300 campuses. It's the first long-term, multicampus study of its kind to parse out differences in treatment and prevalence of mental health issues across race and ethnicity. The study was coauthored by Lipson and other members of the Healthy Minds Network team. \"As a budding clinician of color, I think the tracking of these trends helps support efforts related to stigma reduction and [mental health] education that can be targeted toward certain communities,\" says Jasmine Morigney, a clinical psychology doctoral student at Eastern Michigan University and a coauthor on the study. The researchers used screening tools to measure mental health symptoms, levels of flourishing, and whether a student received treatment during their time at college; participants self-identified their race and ethnicity. They found that the mental health of college students across the United States has been on a consistent decline for all eight years of data analyzed, with an overall 135 percent increase in depression and 110 percent increase in anxiety from 2013 to 2021; the number of students who met the criteria for one or more mental health problems in 2021 had doubled from 2013. American Indian/Alaskan Native college students were found to have the largest increases in depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, and other mental health problems, as well as the largest decreases in flourishing. Back in 2016, about a third of American Indian/Alaskan Native students screened positive for depression, a similar level to other racial and ethnic groups in the study. But by the 2019 and 2020 semesters, half of those respondents were screening positive for depression. \"There has not been nearly enough research on this population,\" Lipson says. \"My hope is that these data document the urgency around understanding some of the unique factors shaping these students' mental health. American Indian/Alaskan Native students need to be brought into the conversation for universities to invest in resources that align with their preferences.\" For white students, the prevalence of non-suicidal self-injury and symptoms of eating disorders increased most significantly compared to other groups. In all other categories-; depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, and one or more mental health problems-; increases were seen the most among non-white students. During the semesters of the COVID-19 pandemic, American Indian/Alaskan Native students and Asian/Pacific Islander/Desi American (APIDA) students reported the most significant increases in mental health concerns, according to the data. Although more students overall are seeking help and access to mental health services on college campuses than they were in 2013-; which is good news, says Lipson-; the prevalence of mental health issues seems to be outpacing the number of students finding and receiving support. And some groups of students are actually less likely to get help than a decade ago. For example, Arab American students experienced a 22 percent jump in mental health issues, but had an 18 percent decrease in treatment over the eight years of the study, highlighting a critical gap between onset of symptoms and accessing help. During the semesters of the pandemic-; when many schools went remote-; fewer students of color were accessing necessary services. \"I find the change in treatment rates among students of color in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic to be quite surprising,\" Morigney says. Treatment declined the most in 2020 among APIDA and Black students. \"Given the impact of the pandemic on this community and concentrated traumatic racism, it makes this finding quite alarming,\" she says. Though researchers tracked significant increases in anxiety and depression during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Lipson says the numbers show a continuation of a troubling trend rather than a singular spike. \"The crisis related to mental health exists beyond the college and university setting,\" Lipson says. But the potential to intervene and reach students at a uniquely important time of life is huge. \"It might not be perfect, but many four-year colleges offer some of the best resources people will ever have,\" Lipson says, since these institutions can use their resources to remove many barriers to care, such as a lack of available providers, long wait times, and financial restraints. University policies to address and eliminate racial discrimination on campus and in healthcare settings can also reduce the mental health risk factors that many students of color experience. \"I would love to see universities work to enhance and promote diversity in their behavioral health staff,\" says Morigney. Students of color may not know if their campus counseling centers have staff with similar cultural backgrounds and could be reluctant to seek out services, she says. \"The majority of mental health professionals are white, and universities are critical for not only providing students with culturally and ethnically diverse care, but also providing opportunities for clinicians of color to serve these student bodies.\" Providing training opportunities to encourage students of color to enter the field of mental health is also a huge opportunity. \"One of the most important aspects of this study is documenting these inequalities and communicating them to folks who can use this information to enact change,\" Lipson says. For colleges across the country worried about retention rates-; many colleges are seeing more students quit before completing their studies-; she says the conversations about retaining students and mental health need to be brought together. It's often the \"same students who have the lowest rate of retention in higher education [who] are the same students who are least likely to access mental health services when they are struggling, and mental health is a predictor of retention,\" she says. \"In the big picture, we need to bring mental health into the classroom so that it doesn't require a student needing to make time or getting motivated to seek help,\" Lipson says. \"There is a lot we can do to bring mental health into the default of students' lives.\" Boston University Lipson, S.K., et al.

The rewritten indictment added Dooling to the case first brought in October, when federal officials said a number of former NBA players combined to collect about $2.5 million from the benefit plan. Dooling, who was a union officer for eight years and eventually became its first vice president, was among three individuals added to the indictment Wednesday. He spent parts of 13 seasons in the NBA as a member of seven different teams. The Jazz said Dooling made the club aware of the indictment Wednesday morning, and he was placed on paid administrative leave by the team. \"It is a case concerning his time at the National Basketball Players Association, prior to him joining our organization,\" the Jazz said in a statement. \"... Due to the ongoing legal process, we will refrain from further comment.\" Dooling was arrested Wednesday in Utah, officials said. The Jazz play Game 6 of their Western Conference first-round playoff series against the Dallas Mavericks at home on Thursday. Also added to the indictment were a doctor and a dentist who officials said were medical providers who facilitated the scheme. Dooling, officials said, \"allegedly engaged in the scheme and recruited other co-conspirators to join the scheme.\" All were charged with health care fraud and wire conspiracy for a fraud that authorities say spanned from at least 2017 to 2020. In October, a prosecutor said each defendant made false claims that ranged from $65,000 to $420,000. The updated indictment Wednesday said Dooling pocketed about $350,000 of plan proceeds illegally. In all, it said about $5 million in false claims were submitted, though claimants did not receive as much in proceeds. Dooling previously was the wellness counselor for the union, helping oversee its mental health and wellness department. He also wrote a book in 2014 discussing, among other things, how he struggled with stress after being sexually abused as a child. \"Health is everything,\" Dooling said in an interview after the book came out. \"It has to be your biggest priority, health of all kinds, mind and body.\"","image_url":"https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2022/0427/r1005447_1296x864_3-2.jpg","source_id":"espn","country":["united states of america","united kingdom","india","australia","singapore","canada"],"category":["sports"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Musk has â€œhuge responsibilityâ€? to fight health misinfo on Twitter, WHO says","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1850931","keywords":["Science","COVID-19","COVID-19 vaccines","disinformation","Elon Musk","misinformation","public health","Twitter","vaccines","WHO"],"creator":["Beth Mole"],"video_url":null,"description":"\"In cases like this pandemic, good information is life-saving,\" WHO officials says.","content":"Enlarge / Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk presents a vaccine production device during a meeting September 2, 2020 in Berlin, Germany.

The United Nation's health agency commented on Monday's news that the tech billionaire has struck a deal to purchase Twitter for $44 billion. WHO officials stressed how damaging misinformation and disinformation could be when it's widely spread in digital spaces like Twitter. \"In cases like this pandemic, good information is life-saving,\" Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, said. \"In some cases, [it's] more life-saving than having a vaccine in the sense that bad information sends you to some very, very bad places.\"Read 9 remaining paragraphs | Comments","pubDate":"2022-04-27 22:30:52","image_url":null,"source_id":"arstechnica","country":["united states of america","india","canada"],"category":["technology"],"language":"english"}],"nextPage":1}
